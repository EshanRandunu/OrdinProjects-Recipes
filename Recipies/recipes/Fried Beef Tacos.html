  <h1>Fried Beef Tacos</h1>
  <img src="./fried-beef-tacos.jpg"></a>
  <h2>Description</h2>
  <p>These crispy fried beef tacos—sometimes called "Arizona Tacos"— are having a moment on TikTok. You press the raw meat onto the tortilla before frying the whole thing for the ultimate crunchy exterior with a tender, juicy filling. And they're easy to make—here's how.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>8 (5-inch) corn tortillas</li>
    <li>1 pound ground sirloin</li>
    <li>1/4 cup chopped fresh cilantro</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons taco seasoning</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Lay 8 tortillas flat on a surface. </li>
    <li>Combine beef, taco seasoning, and 1/2 teaspoon salt in a medium bowl.</li>
    <li>Press 1/4 cup of beef mixture onto half of each tortilla.</li>
    <li>Heat 1/4-inch of oil in a high-sided skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Working in batches, carefully add one taco at a time, flat, to the hot oil.</li>
    <li>Cook, turning once, until shell is golden brown and beef is no longer pink in the center, 30 seconds to 1 minute per side.. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). 
    </li>
    <li>Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate, and sprinkle with remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt. </li>
    <li>Serve immediately topped with onion and cilantro. Serve with lime wedges, salsa, and hot sauce.</li>
  </ol>
